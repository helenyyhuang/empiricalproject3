# Empirical Project 3 - The Creating Moves to Opportunity (CMTO) Experiment
This repository contains my work on Empirical Project 3 from Prof. Raj Chetty's Big Data course, which is publicly accessible at [Opportunity Insights Course website](https://opportunityinsights.org/course/). The project explores the effectiveness of the CMTO program in facilitating moves to higher-opportunity neighborhoods for low-income families.

## Technology Used
- STATA

## How to Use
1. Download the repository by clicking the 'Code' button and selecting 'Download ZIP' at the top right corner.
2. Extract the ZIP file on your computer.
3. Rename the folder after extraction to ensure it is named `project3`.
4. Install Stata (if not already installed) to run the .do files.
5. Alternatively, view the `do.` and `.dta` files directly in the repository, or refer to the `empiricalproject3_helen.pdf` for a static representation of the responses and analysis. 
6. For any queries or assistance, feel free to contact me at yhuan199@alumni.jh.edu.
